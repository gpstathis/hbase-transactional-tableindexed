This package provides support for secondary indexing by maintaining a separate, "index", table for each index. 

The IndexSpecification class provides the metadata for the index. This includes:
<li> the columns that contribute to the index key,
<li> additional columns to put in the index table (and are thus made available to filters on the index table),
<br> and 
<li> an IndexKeyGenerator which constructs the index-row-key from the indexed column(s) and the original row.

IndexSpecifications can be added to a table's metadata (HTableDescriptor) before the table is constructed. 
Afterwards, updates and deletes to the original table will trigger the updates in the index, and 
the indices can be scanned using the API on IndexedTable.

For a simple example, look at the TestIndexedTable unit test in org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.tableIndexed.

<p> To enable the indexing, modify hbase-site.xml to turn on the
IndexedRegionServer.  This is done by setting
<i>hbase.regionserver.class</i> to
<i>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.ipc.IndexedRegionInterface</i> and
<i>hbase.regionserver.impl </i> to
<i>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.tableindexed.IndexedRegionServer</i>

RowBasedIndexSpecification is a specialized IndexSpecification class for
creating row-based secondary index tables. The latter can then be
filtered with org.apache.hadoop.hbase.filter.ColumnPaginationFilter to
obtain accurate data page sizes for use with web applications
(currently, org.apache.hadoop.hbase.filter.PageFilter cannot guarantee
that the number of results returned to a client are <= page size; this is
because the filter is applied separately on different region servers).
Base table rows with the same indexed column value have their row keys
stored as column qualifiers on the same secondary index table row. The
key for that row is the indexed column value from the base table.
RowBasedIndexSpecification indices can be scanned using the API on
RowBasedIndexedTable. The metadata for RowBasedIndexSpecification differ
from IndexSpecification in that:

<li> only a single base table column can be indexed per RowBasedIndexSpecification. 
No additional columns are put in the index table.
<br> and 
<li> RowBasedIndexKeyGenerator, which constructs the index-row-key from the indexed 
column value in the original column, is always used.

For a simple RowBasedIndexSpecification example, look at the TestRowBasedIndexedTable unit test in org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.tableIndexed.

<p> To enable RowBasedIndexSpecification indexing, modify hbase-site.xml to turn on the
IndexedRegionServer.  This is done by setting
<i>hbase.regionserver.class</i> to
<i>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.ipc.IndexedRegionInterface</i> and
<i>hbase.regionserver.impl </i> to
<i>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.tableindexed.RowBasedIndexedRegionServer</i>
